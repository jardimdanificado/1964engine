this file creates references, mainly used for tile translation, 
but of course can be use as well for anything else

- spaces are ignored, dont expect well formated texts as values or names
- the only operator is : which means equity
- must only one equity(:) each line, otherwise you will get an error
- every line must have a name followed by an equity operator followed by a value e.g: name:value
- everything is text
- each line is a reference, dont try to minify the file or put more than one reference per line
- you are discouraged to use symbols except for math formulas
- dont use '//' in any reference, '//' is not a operator here but it can still break the visual and collision

the default syntax is = 
	name1:value1
	name:value
	name3:value3
